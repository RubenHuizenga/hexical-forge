# Hexical-Forge

Unofficial Forge port for Hexical. Credits go to [miyucomics](https://modrinth.com/user/miyucomics) for the original mod.

Hexical is the biggest and feature-rich Hexcasting addon currently out there, adding new patterns, spells, and items. It is a little passion project and there is very little rhyme or reason to what I add other than to make Hexcasting more enjoyable without undermining what in my mind makes Hexcasting so fun and special. This means various little spells like a cheap teleport spell that requires change-of-basis matrices to operate properly, a host of general magicky spells like conjuring flowers, and a flower crown just because it's cute.

Hexical is a kitchen sink addon. I will add whatever I think is fun and while I *try* to have balance, that is not quite a priority.
